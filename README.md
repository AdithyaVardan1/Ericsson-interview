E-Commerce Multi-Agent System â€“ Architecture Walkthrough
This project demonstrates a modular multi-agent architecture for an E-Commerce Assistant, orchestrated using LangGraph and powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o. The core logic lives in main.py, which defines how conversations are routed through specialized agents to respond intelligently to various customer queries.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To build an AI assistant that:

Understands and classifies customer queries

Routes them to domain-specific agents

Streams contextual, accurate responses using tools backed by MongoDB

Handles complex workflows (e.g. multi-intent queries)

ðŸ“Œ Key Concepts in main.py
1. Agent Specialization
You define four agents, each with a clear responsibility:

Agent Name	Responsibility
order_management	Order status, cancellations, returns
product_information	Product search, details, recommendations
customer_service	Preferences, loyalty points, profile info
weather_service	Shipping weather impact and weather-based suggestions

Each agent is created using the create_agent() function, which binds the LLM to a toolset (langchain.tools) and constructs a feedback loop using LangGraphâ€™s StateGraph.

2. Graph-Based Orchestration
The LangGraph setup forms a directed state graph where:

The entry point is the supervisor_node

The supervisor routes user messages to the appropriate agent(s)

After an agent responds, control returns to the supervisor

When the request is fulfilled, the supervisor routes to END
